# AugSet
This is my first time using Github or Unity. I created this Unity project for a class last Winter/Spring and self-taught myself what I needed to know. 
I want to be able to make augmented reality sets for plays. The idea is that the audience would be wearing an AR headset which would allow them to see
a virtual set onstage. This would eliminate the effort needed to build an entire set, which would be used for a few nights and then destroyed. In this project prototype I depend
on a green wall at the back of the stage. I virtually place trees in relation to the green wall target and place an image over the green wall to
act as a background for the scene.
